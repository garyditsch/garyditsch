## Hi my name is Gary Ditsch. 
Iâ€™m currently the Chief Product Officer at VividCharts

## What do we do at VividCharts?
We build products that help ServiceNow customers utilize their ServiceNow data to answer critical business questions, by automating their operational reports. Our applications focus on the data, design and delivery processes necessary to obtain the value from their stored information. 

## What am I interested in?
I continue to learn anything I can about data visualization, analysis, and software development. 

## Top 5 list of current tools and technology I am interested in for continued learning:
- ServiceNow Implementations
- ServiceNow App Development (VividCharts is built upon ServiceNow's Next Experience platform)
- Snowflake / Streamlit (Have a personal exercise tracking dashboard as my playground)
- NextJs (I have a couple personal sites and applications built with Next)
- Remix (Just started building with it)

## Other tools, languages and skills
- React
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Python
- Postgres

### Fun Facts
- Endurance sports is a big passion of mine, which has influenced my personal and professional career in many ways.
- I love to teach and coach. I've helped 100's of runners train for their races, but also helped dozens of developers learn to code.
